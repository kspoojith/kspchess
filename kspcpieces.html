        <h2>Getting Started: How the Pieces Move</h2>
        <p>The first thing you need to know in order to play chess is how the pieces move. Each piece moves in a specific way, and it's important to understand these movements in order to play the game effectively.</p>
        <h3>The Pieces</h3>
        <p>There are six different types of pieces in chess:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>King</li>
          <li>Queen</li>
          <li>Rook</li>
          <li>Bishop</li>
          <li>Knight</li>
          <li>Pawn</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How They Move</h3>
        <p>Each piece moves in a different way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The king can move one square in any direction.</li>
          <li>The queen can move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</li>
          <li>The rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
          <li>The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.</li>
          <li>The knight moves in an L-shape, either two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or one square horizontally and two squares vertically.</li>
          <li>The pawn can move one square forward, but on its first move it can move two squares forward. Pawns capture diagonally, one square forward and to the left or right.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to remember that pieces cannot move through other pieces. If a piece is blocking the way, the piece cannot move to that square.</p>
        <p>Now that you understand how the pieces move, you're ready to start playing chess! Check out our other tutorials for more information on the game.</p>
