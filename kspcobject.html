        <h2>The Object of the Game</h2>
        <p>The object of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means that the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no legal move to get out of check.</p>
        <p>If a player is unable to move their king out of check, and no other piece can block or capture the attacking piece, then the game is over and the player who has their king in checkmate loses the game.</p>
        <p>It's also possible for the game to end in a draw, for example if both players agree to a draw, or if there are not enough pieces left on the board to checkmate the opponent's king.</p>
