        <h2>Tactics: The Pin</h2>
        <p>The pin is a powerful chess tactic that can be used to immobilize your opponent's pieces and gain an advantage. In a pin, one of your pieces attacks an opponent's piece, and that piece is then pinned in place because it cannot move without exposing its king to check.</p>
        <p>There are two types of pins: absolute pins and relative pins. In an absolute pin, the pinned piece is protecting the king, so it cannot move at all. In a relative pin, the pinned piece is not protecting the king, so it can still move, but only at the risk of exposing the king to check.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to set up a pin, but the most common is with a bishop or a rook. By placing your bishop or rook on a diagonal or a file that is occupied by one of your opponent's pieces, you can force that piece to stay in place and limit your opponent's mobility.</p>
        <p>Learning how to use the pin effectively is a key part of becoming a better chess player. With practice, you'll be able to use this tactic to gain an advantage over your opponent and win more games.</p>
